## General Findings
- Aside January and February 2018, the Surf plan always generated higher monthly revenues than the Ultimate plan.
- The monthly revenues for both Surf and Ultimate plans increased monotonically in 2018.
- A good number of customers on the Surf plan exceed their package limits, thus, most Surt plan clients generate additional revenues. However, only few customers patronizing the Ultimate data plan exceed their package limits, hence, only few ultimate customers generate additional revenues.
- Relatively, Surf plan customers behaves like Ultimate plan customers. This results in Surf plan customers exceeding their package limits.
- In total, Surf plan customers generate more annual revenue than Ulimate plan clients (about $95,491.18 generated from Surf plan clients while the Ultimate plan clients generated about $52,066.00). However, on average, in a month, a customer on the Ultimate plan generates more revenue than a customer on the Surf plan.
- The average revenue from users of Ultimate and Surf calling plans differs.
- The average revenue from users in the New York area is different from that of the users from other regions.
